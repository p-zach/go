# go
Go board game implementation in Python.

## Setup
The program requires no setup or extra packages. Run `python go.py`.

### To do:
- Add player types so you can plug in AI / play online (currently the player selection feature does nothing)
- Add forward/backward buttons so you can see previous game states
- Add counters in the sidebar to know how many stones each player has captured
- Add score calculation at game end
